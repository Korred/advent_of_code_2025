# Advent of Code 2025 🎄 
Welcome to my Advent of Code 2025 repository! This collection features my personal Python solutions to the daily coding challenges presented during this year's Advent of Code.
As always, all the fun challanges are available here: https://adventofcode.com/2025/

## About
Advent of Code is an annual event where programmers worldwide tackle fun and challenging puzzles during December. 

Each day brings a new problem to solve, encouraging creativity, logic, and skill improvement.

This repository showcases **handcrafted solutions**, emphasizing **pure human problem-solving** without relying on AI tools such as GitHub Copilot, Cursor IDE or similar assistants.  

## Disclaimer
While AI-assisted tools like Copilot and ChatGPT can be incredibly helpful for reducing development time and boosting productivity, I have chosen to complete these puzzles without their involvement. 
This approach helps me stay true to the core challenge of Advent of Code, which is sharpening problem-solving skills independently.

My solutions this year and last year are deliberately written **without** AI assistance to preserve the integrity of the challenge.
